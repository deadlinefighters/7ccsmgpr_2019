\section{System Design}
\subsection{Introduction}
The team \emph{Deadline Fighters} was given the overall requirement to build a ‘hub and spoke’ file synchroniser which has a single central server (the ‘hub’) to which multiple other clients (the ‘spokes’) can synchronise. The following are the operations that it entails and the priority of implementation we set for our team.

\subsection{Central server’s conflict role}
For central server: it will solve the conflict between multiple users operate at same time. The operate and resolution is shown as follow table.\newline
(Add conflict table here.)\newline
By using the conflict role as above in the file synchronisation tool development allows the system to reduce the number of error reports and make the system organized. It won't cause the system to lose files and report error when the user using two different synchronization functions at the same time to the server (eg. A client edit a file on the desktop application and the client delete the file on the mobile at the same time). It can avoid unnecessary data losses. Because the most important thing about a synchronous system is that you can't lose files. Through the table listed above, our team group can have a common standard for dealing with conflicts in the development process, making the development process more organized.\newline
According to the above detailed requirements design and contradictory solutions, it can help our team have a better assignment for the tasks to the team members and promote the teamwork. Team members can arrange their own time according to their own tasks to complete system functions implementation.\newline
