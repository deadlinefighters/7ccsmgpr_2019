\section{Team Contributions}

As mentioned, our development process was agile. All team members met for an hour on Thursday 1pm to communicate the progress of each sub-group and the plan for the next week. The main location is on the sixth floor of the Bush house SE building.   The meetings were also used to alleviate the difficulties encountered in our development process. The members of the group helped each other to solve these difficulties.\newline

The weekly meeting for Android is scheduled for Friday afternoon, and the desktop meeting is scheduled on Wednesday afternoon. WhatsApp was the chosen medium of informal communication. Independent progress was encouraged so as to not be slowed down by other members. All contributions raised through Pull requests on Git were reviewed by at least two other people to foster peer review and sharing of knowledge.\newline

Below are detailed accounts of the contribution of each member in the team (as written by the team members themselves) during project development process:\newline
